Sodium is primarily from processed foods. <b>One point is about 250mg of sodium.</b> A small serving of French fries or potato chips is about .5-1 points, while a hot dog with ketchup is about 4 points.

<p>
Sodium is primarily consumed as salt (sodium chloride). As a food ingredient, 
salt has multiple uses, such as in curing meat, baking, masking off-flavors, 
retaining moisture, and enhancing flavor (including the flavor of other ingredients). 
Salt added at the table and in cooking provides only a small proportion of the 
total sodium that Americans consume. Most sodium comes from salt added during food 
processing. Many types of processed foods contribute to the high intake of sodium.
