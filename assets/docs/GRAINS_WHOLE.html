The group of whole grains includes: brown rice, oatmeal/rolled oats/whole oats, popcorn, whole wheat, bulgur, wild rice, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and other grains labeled “whole” or “whole-grain”. 
</P>
<P>Whole grains are identified by looking at the ingredient list on a nutrition label. Try to determine if the food is mostly whole grain (close to 100%), partly whole grain (at least 50%), or none/traces of whole grains. If the ingredient is roughly the first, second or third ingredient, the food can be considered ~100% whole grain, and all of the grain amount can be counted toward whole grains. Part whole-grain can be counted as half of the grain going towards whole-grains, and half as total grains. Traces of whole-grains aren’t considered good whole-grain sources, and shouldn’t be counted towards whole-grain. 
</P><P><b>One point is about one slice of bread</b>, 1 cup of cereal flakes (1 fist), ½ cup of cooked rice, pasta or cereal (about ½ a fist), or one pancake the size of a DVD.
