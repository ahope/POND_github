Calories from added sugar, honey, or syrup (sugar not naturally occurring in a food). 
<b>Each point is roughly 50 calories of sugar. </b>1 Tablespoon (the same as 3 teaspoons) or 
5 cubes is about 50 calories. Sugar or sweeteners added to food counts here, as do 
foods that have lots of sugar (candy, desserts). Condiments like ketchup and sauces 
like teriyaki are surprisingly high in sugar. </p>
<p>
Natural sugars are found mainly in fruit & dairy products, so any food that does not 
have fruit or dairy ingredients likely contains added sugar.
